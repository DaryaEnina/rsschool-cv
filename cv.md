# **Curriculum vitae**

1. Darya Enina
2. Discord: @DaryaEnina, Github: @DaryaEnina
3. I'm new to IT, but I have a great desire to learn Front-end, get comfortable and move on. Purposefulness is my main strength: I don't know how to dream, I immediately set goals and make plans to achieve goals. Laziness is a weak side, but it is my engine of progress: I am too lazy to waste time, so I do everything quickly and efficiently. To do this, I constantly study, learn new things, come up with the best ways to solve problems.

   }
   }
